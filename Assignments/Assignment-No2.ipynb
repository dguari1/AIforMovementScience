    "\n",
    "Please submit your assignment as a Jupyter  notebook (.ipynb file). Start a new Jupyter notebook and name it \"YourName_Assignment_2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace *YourName* with your first name and last name\n",

    "Description: This assignment will assess your ability to use functions to solve programming challenges. Some of the points will also require the use of lists/dictionaries to complete the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [1 points] Write a function with one input; the input should be a string variable. Words in the string variable are separated by ```' '```. Your function should count:\n",
    "- The number of words in the sentence.\n",
    "- The number of characters in the sentence (excluding ```' '```).\n",
    "- A dictionary containing the frequency of each letter in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use loops to solve this problem. Ignore punctuation and capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "a. You can break a string using a separator, for instance:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "text = 'Hi how are you?'\n",
    "parts = text.split(' ')\n",
    "print(parts)\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print: ['Hi', 'how', 'are', 'you?']\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Python has a library designed specifically for counting hashable objects efficiently.\n",
    "```python \n",
    "from collections import Counter\n",
    "````\n",
    "c. For example, for the input `Hello World`, the output should be\n",
    "```\n",
    "Words: 2  \n",
    "Characters: 10  \n",
    "Letter frequency:\n",
    "{'h':1,'e':1,'l':3,'o':2,'w':1,'r':1,'d':1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [2 points] Write a function with one input; the input should be a string variable. Words in the string variable are separated by ```' '```. Your function should identify if there are numbers in the sentence. If there are numbers, then the function must return the sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "- Input: 'There are 3 friends with me, 2 of us are older than 18'\n",
    "- Output: 23\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Input: 'My online friend, XX_SAM2000_XX is turning 18 next week'\n",
    "- Output: 2018\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Python has a library designed for searching patterns inside text. The library is called `re` as it is part of the standard libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [2 points] Write a function with one input, the input should be a string representing a date using the following format: month (two digits)/ day (two digits) / year (four digits). The function should ensure that the inputs are valid, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "- 01/20/1985 -> valid input\n",
    "- 02/30/2022 -> not valid input (month 02 only has 28 or 29 days)\n",
    "- 15/12/2000 -> not valid input (month 15 is not valid)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your function should return the number of days since the provided date until today.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hints:\n",
    "    - You can find today's date using the following code:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from datetime import date\n",
    "    today = date.today().strftime(\"%m/%d/%y\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - A leap year is a year that is divisible by four. \n"
