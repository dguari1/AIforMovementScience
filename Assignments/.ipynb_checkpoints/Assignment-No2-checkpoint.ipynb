    "\n",
    "Please submit your assignment as a Jupyter  notebook (.ipynb file). Start a new Jupyter notebook and name it \"YourName_Assignment_2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace *YourName* with your first name and last name\n",

    "Description: This assignment will assess your ability to use loops and functions to solve programming challenges. Some of the points will also require to use of lists/dictionaries to complete the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [1 points] Write a function with one input; the input should be a string variable. Words in the string variable are separated by ```' '```. Your function should count:\n",
    "- The number of words in the sentence\n",
    "- The number of characters in the sentence (without including ```' '```)\n",
    "- The number of instances that every letter of the alphabet appears in the sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [1 points] Write a function with one input; the input should be a string variable. Words in the string variable are separated by ```' '```. Your function should identify if there are numbers in the sentence. If there are numbers, then the function must return the sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "- Input: 'There are 3 friends with me, 2 of us are older than 18'\n",
    "- Output: 23\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Input: 'My online friend, XX_SAM2000_XX is turning 18 next week'\n",
    "- Output: 2018\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "You can break a string using a separator, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "text = 'Hi how are you?'\n",
    "parts = text.split(' ')\n",
    "print(parts)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will print: ['Hi', 'how', 'are', 'you?']\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [1 points] Write a function with one input, the input should be a string representing a date using the following format: month (two digits)/ day (two digits) / year (four digits). The function should ensure that the inputs are valid, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "- 01/20/1985 -> valid input\n",
    "- 02/30/2022 -> not valid input (month 02 only has 28 or 29 days)\n",
    "- 15/12/2000 -> not valid input (month 15 is not valid)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your function should return the number of days since the provided date until today.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hints:\n",
    "    - You can find today's date using the following code:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from datetime import date\n",
    "    today = date.today().strftime(\"%m/%d/%y\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - A leap year is a year that is divisible by four. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. [2 points] Load the provided *json* file into a variable using the following code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json \n",
    "f = open('countries-data.json')\n",
    "data = json.load(f)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    make sure that the file *countries-data.json* is in the same folder as your jupyter notebook. The variable ```data``` is a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary contains information about different countries in the world. \n",
    "    The data includes: \n",
    "    - name\n",
    "    - capital\n",
    "    - languages\n",
    "    - population\n",
    "    - flag\n",
    "    - currency \n",
    "\n",
    " a. How many different languages are the data? Print a list of the languages. \n",
    " \n",
    " b. Find the ten most spoken languages from the data. How many countries speak each language?\n",
    " \n",
    " c. What country or countries speak the most languages? Identify the country or countries and the languages.\n",
    " \n",
    " d. Find the 10 most populated countries in the world.\n",
