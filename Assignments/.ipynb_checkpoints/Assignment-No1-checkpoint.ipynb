    "Please submit your assignment as a Jupyter (.ipynb) or PDF file \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start a new Jupyter notebook and name it \"YourName_Assignment_1.ipynb\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace *YourName* with your first name and last name\n",
    "\n",
    "2) In a new cell print\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "I love learning Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Compute the following expressions \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "4 + 5 * 3 - 6 / 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly explain the result of this operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Google ***Python Operator Precedence***\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Modify the previous expression by adding a set of parentheses '( )' so that the result of the operation is `-3.5`. Briefly explain your results\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Use the math or numpy library to compute the $sine$ of $90$ degrees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: The input to the sin function should be in radians, so you need to transform $90$ degrees to radians. \n",
    "The output should be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) The hyperbolic $\\sin$ or `sinh` is defined in terms of exponentials as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sinh(x)=\\frac{\\exp(x)−\\exp(−x)}{2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute $\\sinh(x)$ for $x=2$ using exponentials. Verify that the result is indeed the hyperbolic $sin$ using Python’s function $sinh$ in the math or numpy libraries as follows:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "math.sinh(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Compute the following expression\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^2 \\sin(\\pi/6) + log_e(3)\\cos(\\pi/9)-5^3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Load the data provided in `file.txt` in a variable (`mylist`) using the following code:\n",
    "```Python \n",
    "file = open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "data = file.read()\n",
    "ls = data.split(\"\\n\")\n",
    "ls.pop()\n",
    "mylist = [eval(i) for i in ls]\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: The file must be in the same folder as your Jupyter notebook, or you must provide the absolute path for the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "a. How many elements are in the list? \n",
    "\n",
    "b. What are the largest and smallest numbers of the list? \n",
    "\n",
    "c. What is the sum of the 10 largest numbers in the list? (you can use `sum()` to add elements in a list)\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Are there any repeated numbers in the list? "
